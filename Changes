Changes for Perl extension Xtract

0.13 Thu 14 Jan 2010
	- Fixed major bugs in the type auto-detection code
	- While type-detection, scan for uniqueness in the first column
	  of the exported table. If the column is both NONNEGINT and UNIQUE
	  create the column as a PRIMARY KEY.

0.12 Mon 23 Nov 2009
	- Fixed some binmode-related bugs on Windows
	- Updated to use DBD::SQLite 1.27

	- Bug fix to moose flag constructor

0.10 Mon  6 Jul 2009
	- If we are building indexes (because the consumer cares about speed)
	  then we now also run ANALYZE during the database cleanup.
	- Separated publish logic into a standalone module.

0.07 Sat  2 May 2009

	- Add support for autotype columns with only NULLs

0.06 Wed 29 Apr 2009
	- Adding timestamp on trace messages
	- Adding dependency on Time::Elapsed for human elapsed times
	- Adding experimental tuning option --sqlite_cache param to boost
	  SQLite memory use
	- Disabled the cleanup VACUUM, it takes an very long time to run
	  (for very little benefit)

0.05 Sun 26 Apr 2009
	- Factored out the indexing and filling code to seperate methods
	- Moved the old ->table to ->select

	- Allow ->table to have a different implementation depending on
	  the type of the source database driver.
	- select, table and fill now track and return inserted rows
	- Automatically generated a compressed version of the database
	- Add a timer to the publishing run and report elapsed time
	- Use (faster?) UNIQUE indexes if column values are all different
	- Indexing is now a specific command line option --index
	- Added quiet mode --quiet
